## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
The vehicle length, gournd clearence and intercept most likely provide the non-random amount of variance.

###Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? why or why not?
Because of the P value is less than .05 there is enough evidence against the null hypothesis.

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? why or why not?

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

In total the varience is within the specification for all lots.

But for Lot 3 it exceeds the varience specification but 70 psi
